# Bikeshare Data Project
This python program reports statistical information from a bikeshare data set based on user input.

### Date created
This project was created August 28, 2021.

### Description
The program asks the user for 3 values:  Location, Month, and Day of the Week.  Based on the user input, the program pulls in data from a .csv file and returns aggregated statistical data  using pandas and NumPy.

Below the displayed statistics, the user is offered the option to first, see printed lines of the raw data, and then whether they want to restart the program or exit.

### Input Guidelines

User input is limited to the months of January though June, and the 3 locations available are Chicago, New York City, and Washington.

### Data files
- chicago.csv
- new_york_city.csv
- washington.csv

### Credits
This project was completed for the [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-for-data-science-nanodegree--nd104) Nanodegree Programming for Data Science with Python.

Data samples for this exercise were provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), a bikeshare company based in New York City.
